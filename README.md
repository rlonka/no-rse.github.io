## The Norwegian Research Software Engineer community

The increasing use of data and digital technology in academia has gone hand
in hand with a strong growth in people who write and contribute to research
software. Positions like data steward, information manager, research data
officer, research software engineer, research supporter and other titles are
increasingly recognized as intrinsic positions in the academic system.

Following the great initiatives in the [UK](http://rse.ac.uk/),
[Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de), [Netherland](http://www.nl-rse.org)
and other countries, we plan to bring together the community
of people writing and contributing to research software from Norwegians
universities, knowledge institutes, companies and other organizations to
share knowledge, to organize meetings, and raise awareness for the
scientific recognition of research software.

We are planning to organize a meetup of Research Software Engineers.

## What is a Research Software Engineer?

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are the people that closely collaborate
with researchers to understand the challenges they face, and then develop
research software to provide the answers. Some have started as researchers
who spent a lot of time developing software to do their research. Others
have started as software developers who have developed a strong affinity
with scientific research.

While the RSEs are extremely valuable to the scientific community, they
currently lack a formal place in the academic system. This means
there is no easy way to recognise their contribution, to reward
them, or to represent their views.

Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a
cause, that is why the term Research Software Engineer was
created. We are now working, together with RSE associations in the
[UK](http://rse.ac.uk/), [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de),
[Netherland](http://www.nl-rse.org) and other countries
to raise awareness of the role, and to bring the
RSE community in the Norway together.
